# Hi, I'm Gil Sunshine. 

I'm a coder and designer (of mostly 3D things). I apply my expertise in geometry and software development in the context of 3D modeling to automate the analysis and generation of geometric data. I have interest and experience in computational design, digital fabrication and computer graphics.

After a couple of years working on the mechanical side of things at robotics startups, I'm now focusing my time and energy on developing software for 3D applications. I'm generally interested in projects that interface with the physical world whether that is through designing, making or sensing.

You can find documentation of a selection of design projects at my [personal website](https://www.gilsunshine.com). You can also learn about the time I made almost anything [here](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.20/Architecture/people/GilSunshine/index.html) or the time I made something that makes almost anything [here](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/people/gilsunshine/systems.html).

I'm currently open to new opportunities -- please be in touch if you would like to chat: gilsunshine at gmail dot com.
