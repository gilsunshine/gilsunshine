# Hi, I'm Gil Sunshine. 

I'm a coder and designer (of mostly 3D things). I apply my expertise in geometry and software development in the context of 3D modeling to automate the analysis and generation geometric data.

After a couple of years working on the mechanical side at robotics startups, I'm now focusing my time and energy on developing software for 3D applications. I'm generally interested in projects that interface with the physical world.

You can documentation of a selection of design projects at my [personal website](https://www.gilsunshine.com).

I'm currently open to new opportunities -- please be in touch if you would like to chat: gilsunshine at gmail dot com.
