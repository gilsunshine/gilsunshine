# Hi, I'm Gil Sunshine. 

I'm a coder and designer (of mostly 3D things). I call myself a Computational Designer. There are probably as many definitions for this title as there are Computational Designers, but to me it means that I'm a designer with technical expertise in geometry and writing software, and I generally use that expertise in the context of 3D modeling to automate tasks and analyze and generate geometrical data.

After a couple of years working on the mechanical side at robotics startups, I'm now focusing my time and energy on developing software for 3D applications. I'm generally interested in projects that interface with the physical world.

I'm currently open to new opportunities -- please be in touch if you would like to chat: gilsunshine at gmail dot com.
